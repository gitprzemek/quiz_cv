# Simple questionnaire and cv pattern.

This is my temporary project on my profile.

### [DEMO](https://gitprzemek.github.io/quiz_cv/) for that page.

- Project is full responsive.
- I use the Visual Studio Code plugin for SASS compilation, so I did not have to use Gulp.
- The icons used are from the FA site.
- For circle animation I used plugin [jquery-plugin-circliful](https://github.com/pguso/jquery-plugin-circliful).
